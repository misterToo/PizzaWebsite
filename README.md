#### Problem Statement
Ordering pizza on the internet should be a seamless process, as to not
frustrate customers who may be hungry/impulsive. With smooth web design,
we can increase the ease of ordering, and as such, the amount of orders by reducing
the effort required to order. Adding a rewards system to incentivise repeat orders and
an account system to reduce the amount of clicks required to order/pay is the goal.
