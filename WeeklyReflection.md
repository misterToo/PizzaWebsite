# Weekly Reflection
### Week 2
Determined that I'm going to be using the Order Pizza API for my project. It's not super complicated, but it is an API, 
and it allows me to try a project that might end up being more interesting. I'm making a website for a pizza place that
allows for the user to accrue rewards on their account. This, I believe, should allow me to implement all the technologies
that I'll run across in the class.
### Week 3
5 hours

Completed Weekly work. I didn't spend a lot of time on the project due to other commitments. Figured out where my old
Java files are which makes things easier. Getting used to file I/O again. MVC comes more naturally than I thought this time.
I've had no problems with passing data between servlets, and what I don't know off the bat I can find fairly easily. Got
in a car accident at the end of the week, so project progress may be limited.
### Week 4
8 hours

Created files for checkpoint 1, not a lot of spare time this week so getting done what I can.
