# Weekly Reflection
### Week 2
Determined that I'm going to be using the Order Pizza API for my project. It's not super complicated, but it is an API, 
and it allows me to try a project that might end up being more interesting. I'm making a website for a pizza place that
allows for the user to accrue rewards on their account. This, I believe, should allow me to implement all the technologies
that I'll run across in the class.
### Week 3
5 hours

Completed Weekly work. I didn't spend a lot of time on the project due to other commitments. Figured out where my old
Java files are which makes things easier. Getting used to file I/O again. MVC comes more naturally than I thought this time.
I've had no problems with passing data between servlets, and what I don't know off the bat I can find fairly easily. Got
in a car accident at the end of the week, so project progress may be limited.
### Week 4
8 hours

Created files for checkpoint 1, not a lot of spare time this week so getting done what I can.

### Week 5

10 hours

Completed weekly assignment, implemented the order class and database. Still struggling with test architecture. Pretty
surprisingly far along with the back end of the website purely based on the assignments.

### Week 6

5 hours

Having database issues with AWS application, otherwise it's somewhat deployed. Website errors out when using AWS database
saying that it's missing a driver class.

### Week 7

3 hours

Got weekly assignment done, tried deploying week 2 to see if it'd run, having the same issues as pizzawebsite. Changing 
MySQL versions didn't fix my issue at all, no progress on that front

### Week 8 (week 7 part 2)

2 hours

As I was starting the AWS deployment, I got an email saying I was going over my AWS limits, shut down all my AWS Instances
I don't think I can get this one done until next month. Can't troubleshoot week 6 any further either due to this issue.
Worked on fixing project 2 checkpoint instead.
